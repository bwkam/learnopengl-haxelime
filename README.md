# LearnOpenGL-Haxe-Lime

## Intro
I once stumbled across an astonishing resource for learning OpenGL, but the problem was that the code was initially demonstrated in C++ (which I absolutely hate), and I didn't find setting up the libraries and things simple as it is with lime. So this repository contains ports of the examples demonstrated in learnopengl.com to Haxe and with the Lime framework which makes everything a ton easier (and fun!).
